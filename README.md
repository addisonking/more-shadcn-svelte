# more-shadcn-svelte

A collection of high-quality, copy-paste components for Svelte 5, built on top of [shadcn-svelte](https://shadcn-svelte.com/).

This library extends the philosophy of shadcn/ui by providing more components that aren't included in the base registry. These components are designed to be copy-pasted into your project and customized to your needs.
